- 👋 Hi, I’m @craigvernon
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis and Business Analysis
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and Python. I am a savvy user with Excel but still building on my Excel knowledge. I do consider myself to be a confident SQL user as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to continue strengthening my SQL, Python, and Excel skills. With SQL being a mandoratory skill in most Data Analysis jobs, SQL practice is my main focus.  
- 📫 I can be reached by this email address: craigdekyvernon@hotmail.co.uk
